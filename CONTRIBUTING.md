# Contributing to Cogman Tools

Thanks for your interest! Quick guidelines:

1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Install dev deps and run tests: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e . && pytest`.
3. Keep code style simple, add docstrings where non-obvious.
4. Update README/CHANGELOG if the change is user-facing.
5. Open a PR with a clear description and before/after behavior.
